				|  Boston, Enter the Dragon uses bluetooth signal strength
				|  to detect when a user enters the room and plays their personalized entrance music. Features for v1.0 of the Mac app 
				|  are still being determined, but we plan to allow the choice of songs and playlists via iTunes and 
				a(href='http://www.rdio.com/', target='_blank') Rdio
				| , as well as the ability to choose what times of day a grand entrance is desired
				|  (arriving at work in the morning, returning from lunch break, coming home after a long day at the space mines).
				|  The app will be free for up to 2 users, with the option of an in-app purchase to allow more.
